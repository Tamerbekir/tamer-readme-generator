# Tamer-README.md-Generator

## Description 
This program uses Node JS, where the user can create a README.md file through their command line terminal by going through a series of prompt questions, which is the necessary information found in a professional README.md file. The user will be asked for a project title, description, installation, usage, licenses, badges, features, contributions, table of contents, and tests. The user's GitHub name and email will also be asked for in any event the user wishes to be contacted. Once the user answers all the inputs, a README.md will generate within their user folder with all of their prompt questions answered accordingly in proper formatting.

## Description 
This program uses Node JS, where the user is able to create a README.md file through their command line terminal by going through a serious of prompt questions, which is the necessary information found in a professional README.md file. The user will be asked for a project title, description, installation, usage, licenses, badges, features, contributions, table of contents and tests. The user GitHub name and email will also be asked for in any even the user wishes to be contacted. Once the user answers all the inputs, a README.md will generate within their user folder with all of their prompt questions answered accordingly in proper formatting.

Then user must then install Node JS by opening the terminal line on the index.js file and run "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" in their command line in their terminal.
